# cookieauth

Cookie-based Basic-Authentication HTTP middleware for Go (golang). Prevents the need to keep entering basic-auth username and passwords over and over.

### Usage

Get package:

``` sh
$ go get -v github.com/jpillora/cookieauth
```

Protect `handler` with a username and password:

``` go
handler := http.HandlerFunc(...)
protected := cookieauth.Wrap(handler, "myuser", "mypassword")
http.ListenAndServe(":3000", protected)
```

Successful logins are hashed and stored in the client's user agent.
